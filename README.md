# 🎄 Santa’s Code Elves 🎄

Welcome to Santa's Code Elves! This is a 4-level game where you help Santa Claus with various quests, from house to house, to deliver presents to children! Isn't that wonderful?
Located in the North Pole, Santa is ready to deliver the presents he has, and he will definitely need some help, so come along and help him before the night is over!

The purpose of this project is to learn how to collaborate, share, communicate effectively, and learn all while helping each other out in the best way we can! The Christmas spirit sure is kind, isnt it?
Anyway, throughout this README.md, you will learn about the features of this project, the testing process, the bugs we encountered and were able to fix, the bugs we encountered and unfortunately were not able to fix, the credits to the amazing websites, videos, and resources used to create this game, and what we learnt!

In the main content of the page, the players will see the levels they can access, having Mr.Santa guiding them. The levels which have not been unlocked will have a lock on them until it is unlocked. Furthermore, here you will be able to start the game, entering all levels in a ascending manner, from 1 to 4. In case the player wishes to stop, there is also an "End Game" button.

This section of the game will allow the players to move from level to level with Santa Claus by their side. It will also allow them to start their adventure with Santa and, if needed, to end the game.

The progress bar was added to let the players know how many games they have won and how many are left to help Santa with. This section also contains a small note, telling them in which event this was created and by who. 

The progress bar will help the players in knowing how much of the game they have completed. It will also give them an idea on when and who created this game in case they did not press the "Elves" button.

In the first level, named the "Grinch Hunt Game", the player will interact with everything inside the yellow box. The player receives clear and understandable instructions, along with a timer and the amount of lives (only 1). The game consists on having to click on The Grinch as fast as possible before the time runs out. Make sure you get rid of him, we don't want him ruining Christmas again! Once The Grinch is defeated, a message and a button will pop up, allowing you safe passage back to the main page. There is also a red cross button, which will take the player back to the main page.

The first level shows the player the usual format for the rest of the games. The location of the instructions may vary. It will also tell the player if they have successfuly completed the level, or failed it miserably somehow.

** Memory Match Game **

In the second level, named the "Memory Match Game", the player will have the same format as the previous game. In this game, the player will have a few seconds after pressing "start game" to memorize all the cards and match them successfully after they have been flipped. There are 6 matches in total, and if you miss one, you must restart and repeat until you win!

The second level will help the player with their memorization skills, as well as boost cognitive skills like memory, focus, and problem-solving through pattern-reconition.

** Quiz Game **

The third level is a small questionnaire where the player will answer Christmas related questions. When the player answers 5 of these questions, they will be able to continue onto the next challenge.

This game helps the user by fostering self-reflection, increasing self-awareness, and providing structure for understanding thoughts and feelings. Furthermore, they help provide structure for memories and develop long-term memory.

** Maze Game **

The third level consists of a maze where the player will have to guide an elf to a present somewhere in the maze. But be careful, each game lost will reset the maze, ehich might make it easier or harder for the player to reach the present. This game has a time limit of 60 seconds. Once the time is over, you will receive a message depending on whether you won or lost.

This level helps the player develop critical cognitive skills like problem-solving, memory, focus, and spatial reasoning, all while teaching planning, persistence, and strategic thinking. 

# Bugs Found and Fixed 🐛😊

Maze Game: In the maze game, the generation for the maze would only appear on one clums of cells and would occupy the whole line, from top to bottom. This was fixed by removing an accidental {}, which had to be placed later after the rows.

General: Problems with wording and case-specific characters.

Javascript logic errors and null/undefined obj.

# What We Learnt

We learnt many things, but the most important was organization and communication. Without those two, the project would have been a complete disaster.

Furthermore, it is also important to be able to ask for help when needed. No one should be scared or ashamed because of their poor knowledge. We are here to learn, and that is what we should do, learn.


# Final thoughts

We really enjoyed the overall experience of this Hackathon. The most enjoyed part was having the opportunity to converse with nea people and learn about their experiences. Funny how talking to random strangers can make your day. For most of us, this was our first Hackathon, so it was definitely a challenge.
